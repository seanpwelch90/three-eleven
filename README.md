ThreeEleven is a web based, full stack software application that helps agencies or local governments receive and track requests for help in their area. 

## Dashboard 
The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of all the current work orders that are currently active.

Each work order is labeled using a color code system, with the highest priority ‘urgent’ displayed using a pulsing icon to denote its importance. 

In addition to the map overview, the dashboard includes a list of current works with basic information displayed next to the work order description. Clicking on the work order shows additional information about the task, zooms the map into that specific area, and provides an interface to edit certain aspects of the work order. 

## Real Time Updates
Using websockets technology, when work orders are submitted by users the new work order is displayed don the screen in real-time without the need for refreshing the page. 

## Companion Native App    
To provide an easy way to submit work orders to the providing agency, ThreeEleven also includes a companion application that runs natively on iOS and Android devices. The interface provides an easy way to add details about the work order, add the specific location of the incident, and even add photos directly from the user’s device to accompany the work request.
